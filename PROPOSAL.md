## Project Description
An online, customizable version of the beloved board game Monopoly.

## Motivation
Monopoly is one of my favorite board games, but none of my friends or
 family want to play with me. Therefore, I have decided to make an online
  version of the game so I can play whenever I want to.
  
## Weekly Plan

### Week 1 (6/1/2020 - 6/7/2020)
- Create board on screen and json file representing each property and its
 prices, along with other tiles
- Create gflags for name, whether to collect $200 when passing go, json file,
 number of computer players, etc.
- Create class to represent and access information in json(see FinalProject)
- Create class to represent user and hold user information

### Week 2 (6/8/2020 - 6/14/2020)
- Create abstract class and classes representing computer(see Mineopoly for
 examples)
- Start working on gameplay -- allow user to roll dice and move forward on
 the board(display this on the screen and update currentposition dynamically)
- Also allow user to purchase properties and houses, etc. and display this on
 the board

### Week 3 (6/15/2020 - 6/21/2020)
- Allow computer user(s) to automatically make their turns
- Display all user stats on the board
- Display number of houses/hotels available
- Display whether or not a property has been bought
- Enforce rent on purchased property, and allow user to pay rent, auction,
 mortgage, etc.
 
## Extension
- Allow multiple players to play/allow gameplay only between users; no computer
- Show history?
